# My gPodder Extensions

This is (or will be, maybe, one day ;) a collection of extensions that I
have written for gPodder, my preferred podcatcher.

## Open In Audacity

I listen to podcasts in quite a few languages, for listening practice. I 
use Gnome MPV as my gPodder player. However, once in a while, while I'm
listening to a podcast episode, I hear something that I want to extract
out and turn into an Anki card.

Since I am lazy, I don't really want to go through the hassle of locating
the file in gPodder's downloads directory. So instead I wrote this little
extension.

Just make sure you have Audacity installed (dnf install audacity), drop
open-in-audacity.py into the gPodder extensions folder, activate the 
extensions and you are good to go (I hope).
